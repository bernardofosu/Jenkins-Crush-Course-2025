Good question 👌 — in Jenkins, seeing “Finished: SUCCESS” in the console log only means your pipeline stages ran without errors.

It doesn’t necessarily mean the email was delivered. Here’s the difference:

✅ Pipeline SUCCESS

Jenkins executed your Groovy code.

emailext step was invoked without throwing an exception.

From Jenkins’ point of view → job is “green”.

⚠️ Email Delivery is Separate

After Jenkins calls emailext, it hands the message to the SMTP server (smtp.office365.com:587).

If SMTP silently rejects it, or Outlook flags it as spam, or authentication is incomplete → Jenkins still logs “Sending email to: …” and pipeline shows SUCCESS.

But the mail may never reach your inbox.

That’s why you’re seeing SUCCESS but no email in Outlook.

🔍 How to be sure

Enable Debug Mode in Jenkins Email Ext

Go to Manage Jenkins → Configure System → Extended E-mail Notification.

Tick ✅ Enable Debug Mode.

Save → rerun the job.

Now the console log will show detailed SMTP conversation (AUTH, MAIL FROM, RCPT TO, 250 OK, or errors).

Check Junk/Spam folder in Outlook.

Verify App Password is being used (if you enabled 2FA).

Make sure from: matches your authenticated Outlook account.

👉 So yes — SUCCESS in Jenkins = pipeline OK, but not proof the email reached Outlook.
The SMTP debug logs will confirm whether Outlook accepted the mail or not.




# 📧 Jenkins + Outlook Email Issue (Authentication Failed)

---

## ❌ The Error You Saw

```text
AuthenticationFailedException: 535 5.7.139 Authentication unsuccessful,
basic authentication is disabled. … AUTH LOGIN failed
```

---

## 🔎 Why This Happens

* Jenkins tries to connect with **AUTH LOGIN** (username + password).
* Microsoft has **disabled Basic/Legacy SMTP authentication** for Outlook.com and most Office 365 tenants.
* That’s why the pipeline shows ✅ SUCCESS (the Groovy ran), but the mail never arrives.

---

## ✅ What Works Instead

### 1. 🔐 Use **OAuth 2.0** (recommended)

* Only supported way for **Outlook.com / Hotmail / Live** accounts.
* Steps:

  1. Create an **App Registration** in Azure Entra ID.
  2. Add **SMTP.Send** and **offline\_access** permissions.
  3. Get **Client ID + Client Secret**.
  4. Do a one-time login to generate a **Refresh Token**.
  5. In Jenkins → **Extended E-mail Notification**:

     * Tick **Use OAuth 2.0**.
     * Provide Token URL, Client ID, Secret, Refresh Token.
     * Keep `from:` = your Outlook address.
* Jenkins will then authenticate with **AUTH XOAUTH2**.

---

### 2. 📦 Use a Different SMTP Provider

If OAuth setup feels too heavy:

* **Gmail + App Password** (requires 2FA enabled).
* **SendGrid, Mailgun, SMTP2GO** (free tiers available).
* Configure Jenkins SMTP as usual (`smtp.server.com:587` + username/password).

---

### 3. 🏢 (For Microsoft 365 work/school only)

* An admin could re-enable SMTP AUTH per mailbox:

  ```powershell
  Set-CASMailbox -Identity user@domain -SmtpClientAuthenticationDisabled:$false
  ```
* Even then, if MFA is on → you still need an **App Password** or **OAuth 2.0**.
* This option is **not available for personal Outlook.com** accounts.

---

## ⚠️ What Won’t Work

* ❌ Using your **normal Outlook password** (fails, basic auth blocked).
* ❌ Disabling MFA and retrying (still blocked, basic auth is dead).
* ❌ Changing `from:` or `replyTo:` (that only affects headers, not SMTP login).

---

## ✨ Summary

* **Error 535** = Microsoft rejected Basic Auth.
* For **personal Outlook.com** → must use **OAuth 2.0**.
* For **Microsoft 365 work accounts** → you may use **App Passwords** if allowed, but OAuth 2.0 is the long-term fix.
* Or → switch Jenkins to an SMTP service that still supports password auth.

---

👉 Next Step: Decide if you want to set up **OAuth 2.0 for Outlook.com**, or point Jenkins to an alternative SMTP (Gmail App Password, SendGrid, etc.).
