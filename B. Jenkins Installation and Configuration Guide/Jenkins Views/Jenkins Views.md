### 📑 Types of Views

1️⃣ **List View**

* 📋 Default, simple list format.
* Allows filtering by job names/regex.
* Lets you add columns (e.g., status, last success, duration).
* Best for grouping related jobs.

2️⃣ **My View**

* 👤 Personal dashboard.
* Automatically displays jobs **the current user has access to**.
* Useful when multiple users share Jenkins, but each wants their own job set.

3️⃣ **Nested View** (requires plugin)

* 📂 Organize jobs into folders/sub-views.
* Good for very large Jenkins instances.

4️⃣ **Dashboard View** (requires Dashboard View plugin)

* 📊 Shows widgets, charts, and build statistics.
* Great for CI/CD monitoring on big screens.

5️⃣ **Pipeline View (Blue Ocean / Pipeline Stage View)**

* 🌊 Visualizes stages of a pipeline.
* Easy to track progress & failures.
